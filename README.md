## Overview

The SDK provides an easy way to use kintone API from Clojure or ClojureScript.

Every API run asynchronously to use [clj-http](https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http) for Clojure
, [cljs-ajax](https://github.com/JulianBirch/cljs-ajax) for ClojureScript and
[core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async).
They return a channel of core.async.

- `kintone-client.authentication` : Make Auth object.
- `kintone-client.connection` : Make connection object.
- `kintone-client.types` : Type definitions such as response object.
- `kintone-client.record` : kintone REST Record API.
- `kintone-client.app` : kintone REST App API.
- `kintone-client.url`: kintone url utilities.

## Usage

Follow bellow the steps.

1. Make `Auth` object
1. Make `Connection` object
1. Call API with `Connection` object

### Make `Auth` object

`Auth` object is used in order to make `Connection` object.

This step is not necessary in case that you run JavaScript(ClojureScript)
on kintone as customize script for kintone app or portal.

```clojure
(require '[kintone-client.authentication :as auth])

;; API token
(auth/new-auth {:api-token "xyz..."})

;; Basic authentication and password authentication
(auth/new-auth {:basic {:username "basic-username" :password "basic-password"}
                :password {:username "login-name" :password "login-password"}})

;; Basic authentication, password authentication and API token
;; In this case, the API token is going to be ignored,
;; and the basic authentication and the password authentication is going to be used.
(auth/new-auth {:basic {:username "basic-username" :password "basic-password"}
                :password {:username "login-name" :password "login-password"}
                :api-token "xyz..."})
```

### Make `Connection` object

```clojure
(require '[kintone-client.authentication :as auth])
(require '[kintone-client.connection :as conn])

;; Auth and domain
(conn/new-connection {:auth (auth/new-auth {:api-token "xyz.."})
                      :domain "sample.kintone.com"})

;; To guest space
(conn/new-connection {:auth (auth/new-auth {:api-token "xyz.."})
                      :domain "sample.kintone.com"
                      :guest-space-id 1})

;; It is only accepted on ClojureScript that there is no auth.
(conn/new-connection {:domain "sample.cybozu.com"})
```

### Call API

You should use `Connection` object as the first argument on every API call.

```clojure
(require '[kintone-client.authentication :as auth])
(require '[kintone-client.connection :as conn])
(require '[kintone-client.record :as record])

;; Clojure
(require '[clojure.core.async :refer [<!!]])

(def conn (conn/new-connection {:auth (auth/new-auth {:api-token "xyz.."})
                                :domain "sample.kintone.com"}))

(let [app 1111
      id 1
      ;; Block the thread and get response
      res (<!! (record/get-record conn app id))]
  ;; Every API response is kintone-client.types/KintoneResonse
  (if (:err res)
    (log/error "Something bad happen")
    (:res res)))
;; success => {:record {:$id {:type "__ID__", :value "1"} ...}
;; fail => {:status 404
;;          :status-text "Not Found"
;;          :failure :error
;;          :response {:code "GAIA_RE01" ...}}


;; ClojureScript
(require '[cljs.core.async :refer [<!] :refer-macros [go]])

;; If you do not pass the domain string, (.-hostname js/location) will be used.
(def conn (conn/new-connection {:auth (auth/new-auth {:api-token "xyz.."})}))

;; Call in go block to handle response
(go
  (let [app 1111
        id 1
        res (<! (record/get-record conn app id))]
    (if (:err res)
      (:err res)
      (:res res))))
```

### bulk request
You can do insert, update, delete at once with `bulk-request`.
`bulk-request` can be performed among different apps.
```clojure
(<!! (r/bulk-request conn
                     [ ;; NOTE: conn is omitted here.
                      (r/add-record app {:name {:value "foo"}})
                      (r/update-record app
                                       {:id id
                                        :record {:name {:value "foo"}}})
                      (r/delete-records app [1 2 3])]))
```
`bulk-request` can be used with:
- add-record
- add-records
- update-record
- update-records
- delete-records
- delete-records-with-revision
- update-record-status
- update-records-status

### url utilities
```clojure
(extract-base-url "https://hoge.cybozu.com/k/12")
;; => "https://hoge.cybozu.com"
(parse-base-url "https://hoge.kintone.com/k/12")
;; => {:domain "kintone.com", :subdomain "hoge"}
(valid-base-url? "https://hoge.cybozu.com/k/12")
;; => true
(extract-app-url "https://hoge.cybozu.com/k/12/show")
;; => "https://hoge.cybozu.com/k/12"
(parse-app-url "https://foo.s.cybozu.com/k/guest/11/1")
;; => {:domain "cybozu.com", :subdomain "foo", :guest-space-id "11", :app-id "1"}
(valid-app-url? "https://hoge.cybozu.com")
;; => true
(->base-url {:subdomain "foo" :domain "cybozu.com"})
;; => "https://foo.cybozu.com"
(->base-url {:subdomain "foo" :domain "cybozu.com" :s? true}) ;; you can specify :s? if needed
;; => "https://foo.s.cybozu.com"
(->app-url {:subdomain "foo" :domain "cybozu.com" :guest-space-id "11" :app-id "1"})
;; => "https://foo.cybozu.com/k/guest/11/1"
(->app-url {:subdomain "foo" :domain "cybozu.com"}) ;; returns nil if given info is not enough or generated url is invalid
;; => nil
```

For more information, See [API documents](https://cljdoc.org/d/toyokumo/kintone-client/CURRENT), `test/`, and `dev/test.clj`.

## dev/test.clj
These tests actually interact with a kintone app (not included in CI). These are good examples of the usage of kintone-client.

### How to run
- import dev-resources/kintone-clj-test.zip
- fill dev-resources/config.edn
```edn
{:auth {:basic {:username "username" :password "password"}
        :api-token "api-token"}
 :domain "domain"
 :app 9999}
```
- try tests

## Note
- kintone-client doesn't convert a camelCase keyword (in kintone REST api response map) into kebab-case.
It costs too much to do so (response map can be so complicated, and keyword can be non-ascii character).
